# Opennlp Enhancer

opennlp-enhancer is an extended framework of NLP(Natural Language Processing) to enhance its performance. It extensively supports **Named Entity** extraction and **Memory Optimization** by extending [opennlp](https://opennlp.apache.org/) framweork.

## Features

1. Memory Optimization 
   
   opennlp-enhancer reduces the size of models loaded into memory by 1/4th of it size. It also uses L-BFGS algorithm to train models and hence it takes less time to converge and it also reduces the size of models. Hence opennlp-enhancer optimizes the memory by doublefold. You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items.

2. Extensive Named Entity support
